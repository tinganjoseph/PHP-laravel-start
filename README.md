# Laravel Hotel API Project

This project is about fetching hotels from two different APIs and storing them in a local database using the Laravel framework.

## Step 1: Environment Setup

### Install PHP
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install php php-cli php-fpm php-json php-common php-mysql php-zip php-gd php-mbstring php-curl php-xml php-pear php-bcmath
```

### Install Composer
```bash
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
```

### Install Laravel
```bash
composer global require laravel/installer
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Step 2: Create a New Laravel Project
```bash
laravel new my-hotel-api
cd my-hotel-api
```

## Step 3: Set Up the Database
Update `.env` with your database credentials:
```env
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
DB_USERNAME=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
```

## Step 4: Create Model, Migration, and Controller
```bash
php artisan make:model Hotel -mcr
```

## Step 5: Edit Migration
Define your table structure in the migration file in `database/migrations`.

Run the migration:
```bash
php artisan migrate
```

## Step 6: Implement API Calls and Store in Database
Edit `app/Http/Controllers/HotelController.php` to fetch and store the hotels.

## Step 7: Define Routes
Edit `routes/api.php` to define your API routes.

## Step 8: Start the Development Server
```bash
php artisan serve
```

## Step 9: Test with Postman
Use Postman to test the API endpoints.

For further assistance, refer to the official Laravel documentation and community forums.
